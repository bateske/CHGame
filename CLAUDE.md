# CHGame: guide for agents

The one repository for the CHGame handheld: the Arduino board package, the
bootloader with the SD game menu (`platform/bootloader`), the graphics and
SD libraries, twenty casino games that are the platform's examples, and the
PC tools. It is the source of truth: the repositories the pieces came from
(CH32SerialBoot, CHGfx, one per game) are frozen and are not synced with.
The aim is one board package that delivers all of it, with one `CHGame.h`
library; [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) says what is done and what is
not, [docs/unification.md](docs/unification.md) measures how far apart the
games' copies of the shared code are, and
[docs/chgame-library.md](docs/chgame-library.md) is the library's design.
Do not start that restructuring unless asked.

Read [README.md](README.md) for the overview. This file is the working
manual: setup, commands, limits, rules and gotchas. Each game also has a
`NOTES.md` with its design decisions and open items. Read it before
changing that game.

## Rules

1. **Simulator first.** Everything except timing and sound can be checked on
   the PC. The real board may be in someone's hands; see "The device" below.
2. **Pixels are the test.** The simulator is deterministic. A change that
   should not alter the picture must give identical frames. Run the game's
   scripts before and after and compare (`tools/check.py --compare A B`, or
   hash the PNG/GIF frames). A change that does alter the picture must
   re-record the README GIFs it affects.
3. **Measure size after every change.** `python tools/device.py build`
   prints flash and RAM. Most games are within 1 KB of full (see Limits).
4. **Generated files are not edited by hand:**
   - `src/assets/Assets.*` comes from `tools/assets.py` and `tools/art/`.
   - Several games generate other tables, e.g. CHWords `src/dict/DictData.*`,
     CHWordWheel `src/bank/BankData.*`, CHCrossword `src/game/PuzzleData.*`,
     CHSlots `src/game/Strips.h`, CHMahjong `src/game/Layouts.cpp`. The header
     of each says what makes it.
   - **CHSd copies:** `games/{CHWords,CHCrossword,CHWordWheel}/src/sd/*`, their
     `tools/chsim/host/{VCard.h,sd_host.cpp}` and CHCrossword's
     `tools/puzzles/fatimg.py`. Edit `platform/libraries/CHSd`, run its
     `tests/run_tests.py`, then `python platform/libraries/CHSd/tools/vendor.py`.
     `--check` verifies.
5. **The shared `tools/` serve all 20 games.** After changing anything in
   `tools/chsim` or `tools/*.py`, run several games' `tools/check.py` and
   compare sim frames against a run from before the change.
6. **`platform/` holds the master copies** of the board package, CHGfx, CHSd
   and the bootloader. Changes are made here, not sent anywhere else. Every
   game builds on them, so a change needs all 20 games rebuilt (size) and
   their sim frames compared; record it in
   [platform/README.md](platform/README.md) (the bootloader's README lists
   its own). Two things to know:
   - `platform/board` is what the *next* board package release will contain.
     Builds use the installed package (0.2.4), so an edit there has no effect
     on a build until it is released or the installed copy is patched.
   - `platform/bootloader/src/sd.c` and `src/fat.c` are a C fork of CHSd: a
     fix to one belongs in the other too.
7. **Credits stay exactly as each game's `NOTICE` and README give them.** Do
   not add names from upstream projects' credit lists.
8. **Every game needs its own save magic, debug macro prefix and debug
   handshake id.** All games share the same two flash save pages. The last
   collisions were fixed on 2026-10-01 (docs/status.md); check a new game's
   values against every other game's.

## Setup

**Linux, macOS or a cloud container:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
arduino-cli config init --overwrite
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls https://github.com/bateske/CH32SerialBoot/releases/latest/download/package_chgame_index.json
arduino-cli core update-index && arduino-cli core install CHGame:ch32v@0.2.4
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt ziglang      # Pillow, pyserial; zig is the simulator's compiler
```

**Windows:** the same `arduino-cli` commands (or the Arduino IDE's Boards
Manager), then `pip install -r tools/requirements.txt ziglang`.

**Notes:**
- **The Boards Manager URL** is still the old CH32SerialBoot release URL:
  it is where 0.2.4 is served from. It moves to
  `https://github.com/bateske/CHGame/releases/latest/download/package_chgame_index.json`
  with the first release cut from this repository (docs/roadmap.md). Change
  it here, in the README and in `platform/README.md` together.
- The board package brings its own RISC-V GCC 8.2 and the `chgame-upload`
  tool, so nothing else is needed for device builds.
- **Linux:** core 0.2.4's `ch32yyxx.h` includes `core_riscv_cH32yyxx.h` with a
  capital H, which only resolves on case-insensitive file systems. Until the
  board package fixes it:
  `ln -s core_riscv_ch32yyxx.h ~/.arduino15/packages/CHGame/hardware/ch32v/0.2.4/cores/arduino/ch32/lib/core_riscv_cH32yyxx.h`.
- **CHGfx needs no install.** `tools/device.py` compiles with
  `--library <repo>/platform/libraries/CHGfx`, and the simulator uses the same
  copy. With plain `arduino-cli compile`, add
  `--library ../../platform/libraries/CHGfx` yourself.
- **The simulator's compiler:** `$CHSIM_CXX` (for example `"zig c++"` or a
  full path plus ` c++`), otherwise zig on the PATH, otherwise
  `python -m ziglang`, otherwise clang++ or g++.

## Commands

Run from a game folder, `games/<Name>/`:

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Release build + size | `python tools/device.py build` |
| Debug build (serial debug protocol on) | `python tools/device.py build --debug` |
| Upload release / debug | `python tools/device.py upload [--debug]` |
| Everything checkable without a board | `python tools/check.py` (9 games have one; `--quick`, `--no-device`) |
| Host unit tests | `python tools/tests/run_tests.py` |
| Build the simulator | `python ../../tools/chsim/chsim.py build .` |
| Run a script in the simulator | `python tools/chsim/chdrive.py --sim . tools/scripts/<s>.txt out/<s>` |
| The same script on the board | `python tools/device.py run tools/scripts/<s>.txt out/<s>` (debug build + upload) |
| Screenshot of a running debug build | `python tools/device.py shot out/shot.png` |
| Sound effects to WAV | `python tools/audio/preview.py out/audio` (prints a hash per effect) |
| Regenerate art | `python tools/assets.py` |
| What fills the flash | `python ../../tools/check_size.py build/release --top 30` |
| Redraw check (5 games) | `python tools/chsim/diffdrive.py <script> <outdir> [ticks]` |

**The bootloader and the SD card** (from the repository root):

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Build the bootloader (+ size report) | `platform/bootloader/build.sh [release\|locked\|nomenu\|app] [--theme=rainbow\|plain\|casino]` |
| Its PC test suite (flash/SD/panel models, power cuts, menu frames) | `python3 platform/bootloader/test/native/run_tests.py` |
| Refresh the committed binaries | `platform/bootloader/tools/dist.sh` |
| Build and pack every game into `out/sdcard/` (+ FAT32 image) | `python tools/sdcard/mkcard.py [--image out/sdcard.img]` |
| Package one sketch / check packages / list a card | `python tools/chgpack.py pack\|verify\|info` |
| Install the menu bootloader on a board | `platform/bootloader/HARDWARE.md` (self-update over USB) |

The release FQBN is
`CHGame:ch32v:CHGame:opt=oslto,rtlib=nano,periph=game,usb=uploadonly`. A debug
build drops `usb=uploadonly` and adds
`--build-property build.extra_flags=-D<PFX>_DEBUG=1`. `<PFX>` is the game's
four-letter prefix in `config.h`, for example `CHF4` for CHFour. Pass
sketch-level defines only through `build.extra_flags`. It is empty on this
platform. Never override `compiler.cpp.extra_flags`.

## Limits

| | |
|---|---|
| Flash for the image | **50,944 B** (0x3000-0xF6FF). The bootloader takes 12 KB (the menu build uses 12,032 B of it, `platform/bootloader/SIZES.md`), and one page of metadata sits at 0xF700. |
| Save pages | Two 256 B pages at the top of the app region. Keep the image ≤ **50,432 B** for both (A/B with CRC), ≤ 50,688 B for one. Past that, saving switches itself off. |
| Static RAM | **18,416 B**: 20 KB less the 16 B boot block and the 2 KB stack. Under ~900 B free, Arduino warns. |
| Stack | 2 KB (games report the high-water mark with the debug `P` command) |
| CPU | 48 MHz, no PLL. Flash has 3 wait states and no cache: code runs at ~5 cycles per instruction from flash vs ~2 from SRAM. |
| Display | 128x128 ST7735S on SPI1 at 24 MHz. CHGfx's 4-bit framebuffer is 8 KB. A full async flush costs ~5 ms of CPU. |

**Tactics that pay:**
- `opt=oslto`.
- `RAMFUNC(name)` (each game's `src/RamFunc.h`) for per-pixel loops. Every
  RAMFUNC also costs RAM.
- `#pragma GCC optimize("Os")`.
- Word-sized loop counters.
- Drawing static layers once instead of every frame.
- Avoid newlib's `memmove`: it is a byte loop in flash.
- See [docs/platform.md](docs/platform.md) and
  [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).

## The simulator (`tools/chsim`)

`chsim.py build <sketch>` compiles the game's `.ino` and `src/` plus CHGfx's
portable code for the PC. `host/chgfx_host.cpp` stands in for the SPI/DMA
part, and `host/main.cpp` runs the game in lockstep on virtual time.

**How it is driven.** `chdrive.py` (one per game, because each adds its own
commands) talks to the sim, or to a debug build on the board, over the
game's serial debug protocol (`src/debug/Debug.h`):

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `?` | handshake |
| `S` | screenshot (8 KB framebuffer + palette) |
| `K` | hold buttons |
| `L1` / `L0` | lockstep on / off |
| `N k` | run k frames |
| `P` | perf |
| `B` | reboot into the bootloader |

Anything else goes to the game's hook.

**Scripts** in `tools/scripts/*.txt` are lists of `wait`, `tap`, `hold`,
`snap`, `gif`, `rec` and the like (see the header of each `chdrive.py`).

**What a run produces.** Screenshots and GIFs go to the output folder. A
`BUG:` line on stderr, with exit code 3, means the game drew into rows
still being sent to the panel.

**Behaviour.** The sim always runs with the debug protocol on and with fixed
work slices instead of timers, so scripted runs repeat exactly. Scripts that
use `free` / `freegif` run on wall-clock time and do not repeat.

**Extra host shims.** A game can add its own in `tools/chsim/host/`. The
three SD games keep the pretend SD card there; set `CHWD_CARD` /
`CHWW_CARD` to a file, or pass `--card <img>` for CHCrossword.

## The device

**Uploading.** `chgame-upload` (from the board package) uploads over USB
CDC. It does the 1200-baud touch, flash, verify and restart itself; no
buttons are needed.

**With the menu bootloader** (`platform/bootloader`, see
[docs/sd-menu.md](docs/sd-menu.md)):
- **Power-on** shows the SD game menu with the installed program
  preselected. A starts it.
- **After an upload** the sketch starts directly (RUN reset). It appears in
  the menu as INSTALLED PROGRAM if it is not on the card.
- **Uploads work while the menu is on screen**, and so do `device.py run`
  and the debug protocol.
- **Holding START for 3 s** in any game goes back to the menu (the shared
  core's `pollButtons()`; `arduboy.startExits = false` opts out,
  `arduboy.exitToMenu()` leaves on purpose). The games don't show it; it is
  the platform's gesture. In the simulator the exit prints a line and ends
  the run, so no script should hold START that long by accident.
- **Holding B at power-on** skips the card and the panel: USB mode.

The board is USB VID:PID `16C0:27DD`, and `tools/serialcap.py` /
`device.py` find its port by that.

**The board may be in use.** Someone may be playing it or listening to it,
and other sessions may share it.

**Before a device run:**
- Say that you are about to upload a debug build or run device scripts. A
  debug build can drop music or screens to fit the protocol, and a lockstep
  script freezes the game, so both look like crashes from the outside.
- Check that no other `device.py`, `chgame-upload` or `chdrive.py --device`
  process is using the board.
- Never probe the port with a bare pyserial open: it can hang holding the
  port. `chgame-upload -port <PORT> probe` is the safe check. A crashed
  sketch (the core's HardFault handler spins, which also stops USB) and a
  board busy in its bootloader look the same.

**After a device run:** put the release build back
(`python tools/device.py upload`) and say it is ready.

**Recovery:** [platform/board/docs/recovery.md](platform/board/docs/recovery.md)
(hold BOOT across power-on for the factory ISP).

## Putting files on the SD card without removing it

[`utilities/CHSDtoUSB`](utilities/CHSDtoUSB) turns the board into a USB card
reader, with its serial port still working beside the drive:

1. Upload it from `utilities/CHSDtoUSB`:
   `arduino-cli compile -b CHGame:ch32v:CHGame --library ../../platform/libraries/CHGfx .`
   then `arduino-cli upload -b CHGame:ch32v:CHGame -p <PORT> .`.
   After it starts, the board enumerates on a new serial port.
2. A removable drive appears whose SCSI vendor is "CHGame" and product "SD
   Card Reader" (`tools/chsd_test.py`'s `find_drive()` finds it on Windows).
3. Copy the files to the card. It must be FAT16 or FAT32: CHSd cannot read
   exFAT. Then eject. Sending any byte to the serial port returns a status
   line (`... CARD <blocks> RW CONNECTED`).
4. Upload the game again (on the new port). This works while the drive is
   mounted, with no buttons. Holding B for 1 s, or START for 3 s, resets the
   board (with the menu bootloader: back to the menu).

**From the menu:** a card built by `tools/sdcard/mkcard.py` has CHSDtoUSB as
the **SD CARD READER** entry. Pick it, copy, eject, then hold B to go back to
the menu (B now resets instead of entering the bootloader).

**What each game reads from the card:**
- CHWords: `WORDS.DIC` in the root.
- CHWordWheel: `PHRASES.BNK` in the root.
- CHCrossword: `CHCW/*.CWD`.

Each is in the game's `sdcard/` folder. See [docs/sd-card.md](docs/sd-card.md).

## Starting a new game

Copy the closest existing game; the newest ones have the most complete
tooling (`check.py`, `diffdrive.py`).
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) is the guide for
developers coming from the Arduboy. Then:
1. Rename the folder, `.ino`, `config.h` prefix (`<PFX>_DEBUG`,
   `<PFX>_VERSION`), the debug handshake id (`Debug.cpp`, chdrive's `--id`
   default), the save magic (`src/save/Save.cpp`) and the RAMFUNC section
   prefix.
2. Update `device.py`'s debug define.
3. Keep `src/CHGame.*`, `debug/`, `save/` and `RamFunc.h` as they are unless
   there is a reason; they are the shared core
   ([docs/game-anatomy.md](docs/game-anatomy.md)). The core gives the game
   the START-held-3-s exit to the menu.
4. Keep that exit unless the game needs a long START hold for itself
   (`arduboy.startExits = false` in `setup()`).

## Gotchas

- **SPI is shared.** The default `SS` (PA4) is the LCD's CS; the card's CS is
  PB11 (`PIN_SD_CS`). Touch the SD card only between `gfx_wait()` and the
  next flush. CHSd and CHSDtoUSB hand SPI1 back as CHGfx left it.
- **Arduino macros clash with names:** `sq()`, `map()`, `word()`, `min`/`max`.
- **Line endings are LF everywhere** (`.gitattributes`). On Windows, write
  files with explicit `newline="\n"`/UTF-8 from Python; the default cp1252
  fails on non-ASCII.
- **Git Bash heredocs mangle backslash escapes.** Write code containing
  `\n` with a file-writing tool, not a heredoc.
- **The debug protocol costs flash** (~2 KB with USB Serial). Some games
  have a `<PFX>_LEAN` switch that drops saving or screens from debug builds
  so they fit. A device debug build is therefore not the whole game. Say so
  if someone will be playing it.
- **Sibling assets:** some `tools/assets.py` read another game's art (for
  example `../CHBlackjack/tools/art/dealer.png`) to check or share it. The
  games must stay side by side in `games/`.
- `tools/chsim/build/`, `build/` and `out/` are build output and ignored.
