# CHCheckers — development notes

Agent-facing notes for continuing work on this game. Rules, controls and build steps are in [README.md](README.md); the platform is covered by the repo-root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) and [docs/](../../docs).

## Snapshot

- Imported from https://github.com/bateske/CHCheckers at commit a9ec530 (2026-10-01). Develop here now, not in the old repo.
- Release build (`CHGame:ch32v:CHGame:opt=oslto,rtlib=nano,periph=game,usb=uploadonly`, core 0.2.4, CHGfx 1.3.0): flash 41,768 of 50,944 B (9,176 spare), static RAM 17,436 of 18,416 B (980 spare). RAM is the tight budget here. It includes the 1 KB think-frame stack.
- Save pages: `../../tools/check_size.py` puts the image at about 42.0 KB, so both A/B save pages fit with about 8.4 KB to spare.
- Verification as of 2026-10-01: simulator only. `python tools/check.py` passes:
  - Host tests: perft from the opening (7 … 179,740), a second naive move generator across all 8 rule sets, both kinds of draw, and 2,000 random games with undo and save/load.
  - The CPU: legal moves, inside its budget, abortable, repeatable from a seed, stronger at a higher level.
  - Every script runs twice with identical frames, and the release build compiles.
- It has never run on the board.

## Design decisions

Made by the owner:
- This is "the same game, number 2": CHChess's iso board, camera, glove and called-out moves, with the flash freed from the chess engine spent on the show.
- The rules are options inside the game: the RULES screen, reached from setup in both modes, offers JUMPS FORCED/FREE, KINGS SHORT/FLYING and MEN AHEAD/ANY WAY. The default is American (FORCED/SHORT/AHEAD), and White moves first.
- The pieces are casino chips in the chess set's colours: white vs silver/blue/navy.
- All four polish areas are wanted: jump combos, the crowning ceremony, captured-piece flair (the trays), and a richer table and title.
- The trays are mats beyond the far edges of the board, built from whole squares so their edges follow the 2:1 diagonals.
  - Rejected: an inlay line around the table.
  - Each mat is in its owner's colours: White's is SILVER with WHITE trim, Black's BLUE with INK trim.
  - In view space, the left mat holds what the viewer took. Chips stack 3 piles of 4, with a HUD tally; the map shows a row of chips seen from above.
- The engine (`src/engine`) is the project's own Apache-2.0 code. No third-party engine or licence file is involved.

## Open items

- Device run, never done (follow "The device" in the root CLAUDE.md).
  - Render profile with `say Y`. The simulator's estimate of about 14 ms max when zoomed is unreliable.
  - CPU speed with `say W` (ms, nodes). This sets the level node budgets and `SIM_US_PER_POLL` in `src/Frame.cpp`, which currently guesses about 6,000 nodes/s.
  - Stack high-water marks with `perf`, the frame stack included.
  - Sound and the title tune by ear (`python ../../tools/audio/preview.py . out/audio` renders them on the PC).
  - No `device_*.txt` scripts exist yet; `check.py` already skips that name pattern. On the board only `G`, `M`, `W` and `Y` exist among the game's commands, so device scripts must start games with `say G` and play with `say M` or the pad.
- Choices approved only as plan assumptions, which the owner has not yet seen on screen:
  - Must-jump UI: the D-pad still visits every piece; pieces that can't jump say MUST JUMP and buzz; the ones that can are ringed. In the middle of a chain a single continuation plays itself and B is refused (KEEP JUMPING).
  - The opponents TOURIST {300, 60}, DEALER {4000, 12} and THE HOUSE {30000, 0} (node budget and margin, `LEVEL` in `src/game/Match.cpp`) are untimed guesses.
  - Slow motion only on a combo's last hop and on the winning capture. The banners are DOUBLE!/TRIPLE!/QUAD!/RAMPAGE!, KING ME! and SWEEP!.
  - Title:
    - Chips drop in, and CHECKERS slams down in the PPOT 3x5 font at scale 3.
    - An attract game plays: `src/states/DemoLine.h`, from `tools/tests/demo_line.cpp`, ending in a triple jump and a crowning.
    - A looping single-voice tune plays (MUSIC option).
  - Departures from the plan: no 1 bpp logo sprite, no plaque, and no decorative carpet chip stacks (just the tray mats).
- The owner's art redraw through `tools/sheet.py`, covering `tools/art/chip.txt`, `chiptop.txt` and `hand.png`.

## Gotchas

- The engine works in steps, not whole moves. A multiple jump is several steps, with the turn staying on the piece.
  - Undo and saves store each step as its index among the steps legal at that moment (`Match.cpp`, `Record::m`).
  - If the order of move generation changes, bump `VERSION` in `src/save/Save.cpp`, or old saves will replay the wrong moves.
- While the CPU thinks, frames are drawn from inside the search (a poll every `eng::POLL_NODES` = 32 nodes), on their own 1 KB stack (`frameStack` in `src/Frame.cpp`).
  - The search can run about 1.5 KB deep in the 2 KB main stack, and a frame needs about 800 B more.
  - With only about 1 KB of RAM free, find the RAM before adding buffers.
- In lockstep (scripts, simulator) a frame is drawn every three polls (96 nodes), so a scripted CPU move always takes the same frames. Keep the search deterministic for a given seed.
- Debug protocol:
  - The game's commands are documented above `debugHook()` in `src/states/Screens.cpp`.
  - `J Q R H A V X` are simulator-only. Positions are set up with `say X <32 cells> <w|b> <rules>`, and chdrive's `auto N` relies on `A`.
  - The protocol itself is the CHGame library's (`chgame/Debug.h`, on in `CHGAME_DEBUG` builds); `dbg::holdWhile(searching)` holds the game's commands while the CPU searches, and `dbg::frameStack()` reports the frame stack's high-water mark as `fstk=` in P (board only).
  - Device debug builds are `CHCK_LEAN` (no saving, no Options or Rules screen: Setup's RULES row steps through the rule sets instead); `-DCHCK_FULL` overrides that.
- Art scale goes in whole multiples: `iso::ascale()`/`sized()` for art (2x from tileH 8, 1x on the flat map) and `zoomed()` for things painted on the board.
- `tools/sheet.py`:
  - The MASTER row holds the art. The WHITE/BLACK rows are the palette swaps (`tools/art/sides.txt`).
  - Chips are anchored at the base centre (9, 17 in the cell). They can grow right and down, not left or up.
  - Keep the glove's fingertip where it is.
  - `src/assets/` is generated by `tools/assets.py`.
- There is about 9 KB of flash room. Only `#pragma GCC optimize("Os")` is used; CHBackgammon's further trims (`no-ipa-sra`, etc.) have not been applied here and are available if needed.
- Saves use magic "CHCK" in pages shared with every other CHGame game; saving here replaces another game's save, and vice versa (README).
- Shared tools: the simulator is `../../tools/chsim/chsim.py` (game-side driver: `tools/chsim/chdrive.py`). Set `CHSIM_CXX` or have zig/clang++/g++ on PATH (see root CLAUDE.md).
