![A toss-up buzzed in and solved, then round 1: a spin, a consonant, a vowel bought, a BANKRUPT, and the CPU players taking over](docs/gameplay.gif)

**WORD WHEEL**: a word-puzzle game show for the
[CHGame](../../README.md) handheld, in the casino
style of [CHBlackjack](../CHBlackjack). Spin the
wheel, call a consonant, buy a vowel, solve the puzzle. 111 puzzles are built
in, and a microSD card with the file `PHRASES.BNK` on it brings that to 606.

Three podiums - you and two CPU contestants, or friends passing the
handheld - play a whole episode: a toss-up, three rounds at the wheel, a
final spin when the bell rings, and the bonus round for whoever is ahead. The
dealer from Blackjack's tables hosts, and has something to say about most of
it.

(Captured from the PC simulator in `tools/chsim`, which runs the real game
and graphics code and renders what the device shows. **The game has not yet
been run on a board**: see "Status" below.)

The host is Press Play On Tape's dealer from their Arduboy Blackjack
(**vampirics**, art; **filmote**, code), as recoloured for CHBlackjack, as is
the 3x5 font. Apache-2.0, like this game; see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

## Status

Checked in the simulator and by host tests only (`python tools/check.py`).
Still to do on a board: the first run at all, render times, how the wheel
and the sounds feel, saving across a power cycle, and the SD card reader,
which has never run on hardware in this game or the ones it comes from.

## How to install

There are two parts: the **puzzle file**, which goes on a microSD card, and
the **game**, which goes onto the CHGame over USB. The card is optional:
without it the game plays with the 111 puzzles built into it. With it, it
draws from all 606.

### Step 1: put the puzzles on a microSD card

1. **Download [`PHRASES.BNK`](https://github.com/bateske/CHGame/raw/main/games/CHWordWheel/sdcard/PHRASES.BNK)**
   (39 KB). It is the file in this game's [`sdcard`](sdcard) folder.
2. **Use a microSD card formatted FAT32** (FAT16 works too). Cards of
   32 GB or less come formatted that way, so a new one is ready as it is.
   Cards of 64 GB and more come as exFAT, which the game cannot read: reformat
   such a card as FAT32 first (or use a smaller card).
3. **Copy `PHRASES.BNK` to the top level of the card**, not into a folder,
   and keep its name exactly `PHRASES.BNK`. The card should look like this:

       SD card
       └── PHRASES.BNK

4. **Put the card in the CHGame's slot and switch it on.** The bottom of the
   title screen says **CARD 606 PUZZLES** when it has found the file, and
   **BUILT-IN 111 PUZZLES** when it has not. (The game looks again each time
   the title screen comes up; a card pulled out mid-game falls back to the
   built-in puzzles.)

### Step 2: put the game on the CHGame

1. Install the **Arduino IDE 2.x** from <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>.
2. Add the **CHGame board package** (0.2.4 or later). The Boards Manager URL
   to paste into *File > Preferences* is under [Installing](../../README.md#installing)
   in the repository's README. Then open *Tools > Board > Boards Manager*,
   search for **CHGame** and click *Install*.
3. **Download this repository.** On <https://github.com/bateske/CHGame> click
   *Code > Download ZIP* and unzip it. The game is the folder `games/CHWordWheel`,
   already named like its `.ino` file (the Arduino IDE only opens a sketch
   whose folder has the same name).
4. Add the **CHGfx library** (1.3.0). Copy the folder `platform/libraries/CHGfx`
   from the download into the `libraries/` folder of your sketchbook (its
   location is shown in *File > Preferences*).
5. Open `games/CHWordWheel/CHWordWheel.ino` in the IDE and set:
   - *Tools > Board*: **CHGame**
   - *Tools > Optimize*: **Smallest + LTO**. The game does not fit without it.
   - *Tools > USB*: **Upload only**
   - *Tools > Port*: the CHGame's port
6. Plug the CHGame in by USB and click **Upload** (the arrow button).

The same from the command line:

    arduino-cli compile -b CHGame:ch32v:CHGame:opt=oslto,rtlib=nano,periph=game,usb=uploadonly CHWordWheel
    arduino-cli upload  -b CHGame:ch32v:CHGame -p COMx CHWordWheel

That is 50.3 KB of the 50,944-byte program area. The last two flash pages are left for saving.

## Your own puzzles

To add your own puzzles, add `CATEGORY|PUZZLE` lines to `tools/phrases/phrases.txt`
and rebuild `sdcard/PHRASES.BNK` with `python tools/phrases/build_bank.py`: the script checks that each fits the board.

## Playing

| Button | Your turn | The wheel | Picking letters, solving | Toss-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-pad | left/right: SPIN, VOWEL $250, SOLVE | | move over the letters | buzz in (podium 1 of two or three humans) |
| A | choose | hold to wind up, let go to spin | pick the letter; when solving, type it, then confirm | buzz in |
| B | | | back out of buying a vowel; when solving, rub out | buzz in |
| SELECT | | | when solving: next blank panel | buzz in (podium 2 of three humans) |
| START | pause: resume, options, save & quit | | | |
| A, held | hurries the host and a CPU's spin | | | |

With one human at the podiums any button buzzes in.

## The show

- **Toss-up** ($1,000, and $2,000 before round 3): panels turn one at a
  time until someone buzzes in and solves. A wrong answer locks you out. The
  winner starts the next round.
- **A round**: on your turn, spin, buy a vowel ($250) or solve. A consonant
  that is there pays the wedge's value for each panel it turns, and you go
  again; one that is not passes the turn. Only the contestant who solves
  keeps their round's money, and the house makes a small win up to $1,000.
- **The wheel** has 24 wedges of three peg slots:
  - **BANKRUPT** takes your round money and any tokens; **LOSE A TURN**
    just the turn.
  - **FREE PLAY**: any letter - a vowel costs nothing, a miss costs nothing.
  - The **top-dollar wedge**: $2,500, then $3,500, then $5,000.
  - Round 1: the **WILD CARD** (play it after a hit to call a second
    consonant at the same value, or take it to the bonus round for an extra
    consonant) and the **trip** ($3,000 if you go on to win the round); each
    is yours only if the letter you call is there.
  - Round 2: two **mystery wedges** - $1,000 a letter, or flip it for
    $10,000 or a bankrupt.
  - Round 3: one wedge is split **bankrupt / $10,000 / bankrupt**.
- **The final spin**: in round 3, after six spins, the bell rings at the
  next change of turn. The host spins once; from then on each contestant
  calls one letter (consonants pay that wedge plus $1,000, vowels are free
  and worth nothing) and has five seconds to solve or pass.
- **The bonus round**: the leader spins for an envelope ($25,000 to
  $100,000), is given R S T L N E, picks three more consonants and a vowel,
  and has ten seconds to say "got it" and type the answer.
- **The CPU contestants**: ACE is sharp and solves early; DOT buys every
  vowel she can afford and never gambles; BUZZ guesses, solves late, flips
  anything and now and then calls a letter that has been called.

Options: FULL EPISODE or QUICK PLAY (a toss-up, round 3 and the bonus),
pace, the solve clocks (TV or twice as long), sound, and the host's jacket.
The episode is saved at the start of every toss-up and round; SAVE & QUIT
keeps your place, and CONTINUE starts that step again with a new puzzle.

## How it fits

- **Flash**: 50,408 of 50,432 bytes (the limit that keeps both save pages).
  Roughly: the rules 6 KB, screens and presentation 14 KB, drawing and
  effects 7 KB, sound 2.5 KB, the SD reader and bank 2.3 KB, the built-in
  puzzles 1.4 KB, the rest core, USB and CHGfx. The built-in bank's share is
  one number (`FLASH_BYTES` in `tools/phrases/build_bank.py`): every
  kilobyte freed elsewhere is about eighty more puzzles without a card.
- **Compiler settings**: every size-optimised file carries
  `#pragma GCC optimize("Os", "no-ipa-sra", "no-inline-functions-called-once",
  "no-jump-tables", "no-guess-branch-probability")`. Against plain `-Os` with
  LTO those four save about 1 KB on this game; each was measured on its own,
  and the ones that made it bigger were left out. The hot pixel loops run
  from SRAM (`RAMFUNC`), where these settings don't matter.
- **Puzzles in flash** are Huffman-coded text (about 12 bytes a puzzle at
  this size, 10 at 600), grouped by section and category, already wrapped
  onto the board's four rows by the build script; the category names are
  coded the same way, after the puzzles. **On the card** they are plain
  64-byte records, so a puzzle is one block read.
- **No repeats**: each section is dealt in a shuffled order fixed by a seed
  (a small Feistel permutation), so the save holds a seed and three
  counters, not a list.
- **Drawing**: the play screen redraws only what changed - the wall, the
  board panel by panel, the podiums, the prompt bar - and whatever a banner
  or confetti passed over. The wheel's wedges are spans between edges
  stepped in fixed point toward a hub below the screen. Estimated render
  times (simulator, scaled by the CHGfx benchmark) are 3 to 6 ms a frame at
  the busiest; not yet measured on a board.
- **Depth** comes from the palette's own shades and 50% dithers, lit from
  the top left throughout: raised letter tiles with a shadowed edge, empty
  slots sunk into the board, a gold bezel with corner bulbs in the cycling
  colour, podiums with a lit header, a groove and a shaded foot, keycap
  letters in the picker, drop shadows under the rack, the bubble and the
  printed lettering, and a wheel shaded like a drum - dark at both sides and
  toward the hub, metal dividers, brass pegs, the rim's shadow across the
  face.
- **The wheel never decides anything**: the rules draw the stop, and the
  spin is solved to end there.

## Development

- `python tools/check.py` - everything that can be checked without a
  board: the banks rebuilt, host tests, every simulator script twice, the
  redraw check, the device build and its size.
- `python tools/tests/run_tests.py` - host tests of the rules (thousands of
  CPU episodes), the flash bank's decoder and the SD bank's reader.
- `python ../../tools/chsim/chsim.py build .` then
  `python tools/chsim/chdrive.py --sim . tools/scripts/round.txt out/round` -
  run a script in the simulator; screenshots land in the output folder.
  `set CHWW_CARD=sdcard/PHRASES.BNK` puts the SD bank in the simulator's slot
  (on a pretend FAT16 card, so the FAT code runs too).
- `python tools/chsim/diffdrive.py tools/scripts/diff/diff_round.txt out/d 1` -
  compares the game against a build that redraws everything every frame.
- `python tools/phrases/build_bank.py [--bytes N] [--curve]` - the banks.
- `python tools/audio/preview.py out/audio` - every sound and the tune as
  WAV files.
- `python tools/mockup.py` - the layout mock-ups the screens were built from.
- `python tools/device.py build|upload [--debug]` - the device build. (A
  debug build carries the test protocol, and leaves out the Setup, Options
  and Stats screens to make room for it.)
