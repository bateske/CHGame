 * Application side of the CHGame boot-request handshake.

 * script does -- so startup neither loads nor zeroes it and the value survives
 * NVIC_SystemReset(). Verified on hardware: SRAM does survive a warm reset on
 * this part, but NOT a power cycle, which is what we want. A marker that
 * outlived power loss could strand a device in the bootloader.
