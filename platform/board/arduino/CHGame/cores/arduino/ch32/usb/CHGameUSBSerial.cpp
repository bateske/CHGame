 * This used to detach, delay(100), attach, then delay(1000) "for enumeration".
 * None of that was doing what it claimed. Enumeration is handled entirely in
 * USBFS_IRQHandler -- USB_EP0_SETUP/IN/OUT are only ever reached from the ISR,
 * and USB_ENUM_OK is set there on SET_CONFIGURATION -- so the main loop
 * contributes nothing to it. Blocking here and running setup() are equally good
 * places for the CPU to be while the host enumerates; the difference is that
 * blocking cost every sketch 1.1 s before it could touch the display.
 *
 * The same goes for the upload handshake: the 1200-baud touch is detected in
 * the control path and acted on at the end of the interrupt, deliberately so
 * that uploads never depend on the sketch reaching loop(). Returning early here
 * cannot make a board harder to recover.
 *
 * The old detach + delay(100) was for the host to notice a disconnect before we
 * re-attach. It is redundant: on a cold boot the bootloader never brought USB
 * up at all, and after an upload proto_shutdown() already drops the pull-up and
 * spins 30 ms before jumping here. USB_init() also resets the core itself. */

 * endpoint. So on a board running from a battery or a wall wart, with no host
 * at all, the old path hung forever on the 65th byte of the first print in
 * setup(). That was true before this change too; it was merely hidden behind
 * the 1 s pad, which made it look like a rare bug instead of a guaranteed one.
 *
 * Now that setup() starts while enumeration is still in flight, this has to be
 * correct rather than lucky, so:
 *   - no host yet (or ever)  -> drop the byte, keep running
 *   - host present but stalled -> wait, but only up to a bound, then drop
 *
 * Dropping and reporting success is the right Arduino contract here: Print will
 * otherwise retry forever, and a game that stutters because someone closed the
 * serial monitor is a worse failure than a lost debug line. Sketches that would
 * rather block until the port is real should say so with waitForPC(). */
