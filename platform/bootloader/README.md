# CHGame bootloader with the SD game menu

The CHGame's permanent bootloader (flash 0x0000-0x2FFF, 12 KB), extended
with a game menu that installs games from a FAT microSD card. It keeps USB
uploading, the recovery paths and the memory map of the 0.2.4 bootloader.
The players' guide is [docs/sd-menu.md](../../docs/sd-menu.md). What it
reads from the card is [spec/card.md](../../spec/card.md) (made by the
tools from a `.chgame`, [spec/chgame.md](../../spec/chgame.md)); the CHG
file it installs, and what a game needs to know, are in
[spec/chg.md](../../spec/chg.md).

## What it does

```
reset -> read and clear the boot request (16 B retained at 0x20000000)
 |- RUN "CHGR" and the installed program is valid -> jump to it (nothing else touched)
 |- USB "CHGB" (1200-baud touch, CHSDtoUSB, debug 'B') -> USB upload mode, panel says so
 |- B held at power-on                             -> USB upload mode, card and panel untouched
 '- otherwise (power-on, any other reset)
      pins to safe levels; panel reset; the card is read during the panel's 120 ms waits
      |- no card / no FAT volume / no entries: program valid -> RUN reset (no menu, as before)
      |                                        else          -> "NO GAMES" + USB mode
      |- power-on, START not held, GAMES/MENU.IDX flags a launch entry (followed into folders):
      |     installed -> RUN reset at once (the panel never woken); else install, RUN reset
      '- the menu: GAMES/'s folders and *.CHG in MENU.IDX's order, then by title, over
         the folder's MENU.BG; the installed game marked and preselected
           A on a folder           -> its list; B goes back (4 levels)
           A on the installed game -> RUN reset (no flash write)
           A on another game       -> install, then RUN reset
           USB upload starts       -> "USB UPLOAD", protocol only (HELLO doesn't count)
USB mode has no timeout; a fresh press of B returns to the menu.
```

**Leaving a game.** A game returns to the menu with a plain reset, so no
request is involved. The casino games do this when START is held for 3 s
(their shared `CHGame` core; [docs/sd-menu.md](../../docs/sd-menu.md)). The
reset flags show that the power did not go off, so a B still held then is
not taken for the power-on escape. The menu ignores keys that are already down when it appears, so the
START still held does not start anything.

**The install** (`src/install.c` over `src/update.c`, the same transaction a
USB upload uses):

1. **Pass 1, nothing erased.** Check the header (magic, header CRC, format,
   target and layout ids, payload size against the file size). Refuse a
   bootloader image (signature `CHBL`). Stream the whole payload along its
   FAT chain and check its CRC.
2. **Pass 2.**
   - Erase the metadata page: the installed program is invalid from this
     instant.
   - Write the payload page by page. Pages whose flash already holds the
     same bytes are skipped. Each page is read back. A card read error
     re-initialises the card and retries twice.
   - CRC what is now *in flash* against the header.
   - Program the metadata page last, without a second erase.
3. **Start it.** Wait for every key to be released, then RUN reset.

A power cut at any point leaves either the complete new program or no valid
program. Never a partial one, never the old one after the erase began. The
boot region is never written. The native suite cuts the power at every flash
operation of an SD install and of a USB upload and checks exactly this.

## Differences from the spec (`CH32SDBootloader.md`)

The spec was the baseline. These are the decisions taken with the owner, and
the measurements behind them.

| Spec | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|
| No LCD, font or menu in the bootloader; a `MENU.CHG` launcher installed into application flash | The menu is in the bootloader | Showing a flash-installed launcher would erase the game every time; the owner's goal is no flash wear. It fits: release build 11,908 B of 12,288 B (menu v2). |
| Game first at power-on; the menu on request | The menu at every power-on, the installed game preselected; a card may name a launch game instead (START held: the menu) | Arduboy FX behaviour, and free now: showing the menu writes nothing. The launch game came with menu v2. |
| Launcher copies the game to `UPDATE.CHG`, the bootloader installs that fixed name | The bootloader reads `/GAMES/*.CHG` itself; no SD writes at all | No FAT write code, no card corruption on a power cut, no 50 KB copy. |
| Fall back to raw sectors if FAT does not fit | FAT16 + FAT32, MBR or superfloppy, any fragmentation | Fits (FAT 864 B + SD 770 B without LTO). |
| Petit FatFs vs custom reader | The custom reader: a C port of CHSd's `Fat.cpp` | CHSd is already in the repository, tested against FAT16/FAT32 images and smaller than Petit FatFs in its read-only configuration. |
| (keep USB recovery) | USB upload unchanged, plus RUN by reset, no double erase, the bootloader signature | See below. |

**The decision gates (spec section 41):**
- **A.** The 12 KB reservation is kept and `APP_START` stays at 0x3000; see
  [SIZES.md](SIZES.md).
- **C.** Retained request plus reset is the only way the bootloader starts a
  program.
- **D.** Fragmentation is always supported.
- **E.** CMD17 single-block reads.
- **F.** Polled SPI, no DMA.
- **G.** The proven 256 B erase/program is kept.

## Changes to the 0.2.4 code (all covered by the native tests)

- **`update.c`, the shared flash transaction.**
  - BEGIN no longer pre-erases the image: each page was erased twice per
    upload.
  - Identical pages are skipped.
  - The metadata page is programmed without a second erase. It is the page
    every install erases, so this halves its wear.
- **RUN resets with a RUN request** instead of jumping, so a program always
  starts from reset state. `jump_to_app()` runs only at the very top of the
  boot.
- **The bootloader signature.** The release image carries `CHBL` in a
  reserved vector slot (offset 8), and `appmeta_check()` refuses any image
  that carries it. A bootloader staged for self-update can then never be
  launched as a program, even if the host stops between staging and
  promoting it. The Python uploader (`host/py`) also unlocks before staging.
- **Trims.**
  - The Arduino core 0.2.4's direct-register `USB_init`.
  - No `atexit`/`__libc_init_array`.
  - No SPL GPIO/RCC calls.
  - A 2 Hz blink in USB mode instead of the LED pattern module.
  - No `memcpy`.
- **`BOOT_VERSION` 2**, reported by HELLO; **3** with menu v2 (below).
- **Menu v2 removed `fault.c`** (the bench LED reporter; a fault now stops
  the bootloader where it is) **and the STATUS and READ commands** (bench
  diagnostics: they answer `ST_ERR_BADCMD`; both uploaders skip `-verify`'s
  readback on BOOT_VERSION 3, where END's own CRC check of the flash
  remains).
- **Unchanged:** the HELLO payload, the upload and self-update commands, the
  USB identity, the memory map, the metadata format, the retained-block
  address and the `CHGB` request. Core 0.2.4 sketches and both host
  uploaders work as before.

## Building

```
./build.sh [release|locked|nomenu|app] [--style=rainbow|static] [--nolto]
```

The toolchain comes with the board package (`arduino-cli core install
CHGame:ch32v@0.2.4`) and is found in the usual Arduino folders, or set
`CHGAME_TOOLCHAIN`. On Windows, use Git Bash. Output goes to
`build/<mode>[-static]/chgame_boot.{bin,elf,map,lst}`, and a size report is
printed.

| Mode | What | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `release` | menu + USB upload + developer self-update. **The one to install.** | 11,908 B |
| `release --style=static` | the same, colour 15 as the card's palette gives it (the picture's magenta) instead of the turning rainbow | 11,684 B |
| `locked` | `release` without self-update; later bootloader updates then need the factory ISP | 11,588 B |
| `nomenu` | USB upload + self-update, the old boot decision on the new code (hardware step HW2a) | 5,400 B |
| `app` | the menu as a program linked at 0x3000: a dry run of card, panel and keys under any bootloader, with no USB and no flash writes (HW1) | 6,408 B |

`tools/dist.sh` builds all four into [release/](release) with
`SHA256SUMS`. Two runs give identical files.

### Menu v2 (2026-10-03): the card's look, folders, order, launch

The menu draws into a framebuffer and takes its look from the card
([spec/card.md](../../spec/card.md); the constants are
`shared/chgame_card.h`):

- **The framebuffer.** 128x128 pixels of 4 bits (8 KB of RAM; with the
  240-row game table the menu build uses 20,448 B of 20,480). It is sent to the panel through a
  16-colour palette, one row range at a time (`lcd_flush`).
- **Colour 15, two styles** (`./build.sh release --style=rainbow|static`;
  *Tools > Bootloader*: SD Game Menu (Rainbow), the default, or (Static)).
  It is the selection bar, the boxes and every `#FF00FF` pixel of a card's
  picture.
  - **Rainbow:** one colour turning through the colour wheel (`lcd_step`,
    every 40 ms, a turn in about 4 s); only the rows that show it are
    resent. (Until 2026-10-03 the hue also moved with x + y, a gradient:
    the solid colour is 48 B smaller and frees its 510 B table.)
  - **Static:** the palette's entry 15, like any other colour: the tools
    write the picture's `#FF00FF` there, so the picture shows as painted.
    No animation at all (11,684 B). (It was White until 2026-10-03, when
    entry 15 was white on every card.)
- **`MENU.BG`**, in GAMES/ or any folder below it (a folder without one keeps
  its parent's): a 128x128 picture with its palette. Colours 11-14 are the
  menu's text, greyed text, selected text and chip. It is read from the
  card again for every new picture: there is RAM for one copy, not two. Every
  card the tools prepare has one (`spec/assets/menu-default.png`: the CHGAME
  logo at full resolution, in colour 15). The logo is the picture's: the
  bootloader draws no title, and nothing over rows 0-19 and 120-127.
  Without a picture, or with a broken one, the list is drawn on black.
  `chgame background` makes and previews pictures
  ([docs/menu-image.md](../../docs/menu-image.md)).
- **Folders.** A folder is a row with `>`. A opens it, B goes back, 4
  levels deep. A folder lists 240 entries (`MENU_MAX_GAMES`, `menu.h`):
  each is 32 B of RAM, and 240 fill the RAM the framebuffer, the buffers
  and the 2 KB stack leave. More games go in folders, which have no limit.
  The first menu listed 128 games, all in `GAMES/`.
- **`MENU.IDX`.** It gives each folder's order, folder titles longer than
  8.3, and the launch flag. Entries it does not name follow, by title.
- **Launch.** At a real power-on with START not held, the flagged entry runs
  (followed into folders): at once if installed, else after its install.
  START held, or any software reset (a game's 3 s START exit), shows the
  menu.
- **Errors are numbers.** Every check is still made; only the text went.
  docs/sd-menu.md lists the codes: 1 card read, 2 damaged, 3 a bootloader
  image, 4 install failed (no game left installed), 5 not a CHG file it can
  install. A file the menu cannot read is shown grey under its 8.3 name.
- **What paid for it** ([SIZES.md](SIZES.md)): the error texts, `fault.c`,
  STATUS and READ, the exFAT diagnosis, the `n/N` counter, the plain and
  casino themes (a card's background replaces them), the fallback title,
  the rainbow's gradient, and out-of-line SPI bytes. The release image went
  from 12,032 B to 11,908 B.
- **A redraw** reads the background (17 sectors) and sends the whole screen.
  The model's wire time is about 25 ms; on the board scrolling felt right
  (2026-10-03: [test/hil/RESULTS-2026-10-03.md](test/hil/RESULTS-2026-10-03.md)).
- `python3 tools/screens.py` redraws the pictures in `docs/` after
  `test/native/run_tests.py -k boot`.

## Changes after the first hardware run (2026-10-01)

Found on a real board ([test/hil/RESULTS-2026-10-01.md](test/hil/RESULTS-2026-10-01.md)),
fixed and tried on that board again. Both cost no flash.
- **The B escape tests the power-on flag** (`hal_soft_reset()`, `hal.h`).
  It tested the software-reset flag, which the chip also sets at power-on,
  so B was never read and the menu always appeared.
- **The box is 8 pixels wider and the progress bar runs under the title.**
  A title is drawn 114 pixels wide and covered the inner border column of
  the 112-pixel box. The bar starts and ends where the title field does.
- **Run through the native tests on 2026-10-02.** The suite now also runs
  on Windows (see Testing). All of it passes; the twelve frames with a box
  were re-pinned in `frames.json`, and the pictures in `docs/` redrawn. The
  host model of the reset cause needed no change: `hal_soft_reset()` is
  modelled as a whole ("software reset and not power-on"), not flag by flag.

## Testing

```
python3 test/native/run_tests.py            # about 30 s; needs cc and Pillow
```

On Windows the harness cannot run natively (it forks a process per boot).
There `run_tests.py` cross-compiles the test programs for Linux with zig
(`pip install ziglang`) and runs them under WSL: any distribution, even
Docker Desktop's, since the programs are static. That mode has UBSan but
not ASan. `$CHBOOT_WSL` names the distribution, `$CC` forces a native
compiler.

The portable sources are compiled for the PC against `test/native`'s
hardware layer:
- **`host_hal.c`**: a fake flash that tears the operation at a chosen power
  cut, the retained block, the virtual clock, scripted keys and a fake USB.
- **`sd_model.c`**: an SPI-level SD card. It covers SDSC v1/v2 and SDHC,
  slow initialisation, access time, error tokens and timeouts, and cards an
  MCU reset left in the middle of a multi-block read or write.
- **`lcd_model.c`**: an ST7735 that turns the real SPI byte stream into the
  picture on the glass and flags timing violations.

Each boot runs in a fresh process, so statics start from zero as after a
real reset; flash, the card and the panel persist in shared memory.

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| core_nomenu / core_menu / core_locked | the update path, the protocol (probes vs claims, resync after noise), self-update, the boot decision, a power cut at every flash operation of a USB upload |
| sd | the SD driver against the card model, the FAT reader against FAT16/FAT32 images (MBR, superfloppy, partition 4, fragmented files and folders, decoy labels, four kinds of broken chain, exFAT, blank), every CHG header error |
| boot | no card, empty card, menu, install, switch, every bad CHG file, USB notice, B escape, a probing host, upload at the menu, the card dying mid-install, a power cut at every flash operation of an SD install; and on cards made by `tools/chcart`'s `runtime.prepare()`: index order, an entry not in the index, an index record with no file, nested folders and B, launch (installed and not), START held at power-on, a software reset, a broken `MENU.BG`, an empty folder, a folder of 250 games (240 listed) |
| boot_static | the static style: the same menu's screens, install, folders and launch |
| boot_real | the real card from `chgame card --image out/sdcard.img`: the games at its top level installed in turn, each over the last, checked |
| frames | 26 menu screens (17 rainbow, 9 static) pinned by hash in `test/native/frames.json`. PNGs are in `test/native/build/frames/` |
| preview | `chgame background --preview` (tools/chcart/background.py) against the bootloader's own frames of a cart card: every pixel but the rainbow's (rainbow), every pixel (static) |

The hardware steps are in [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md).

## Installing it on a board

- **From the Arduino IDE, over USB** (any board that has a bootloader with
  self-update, the 0.2.4 one included): *Tools > Bootloader* **SD Game
  Menu (Rainbow)** (`release/chgame_sdboot.bin`) or **(Static)**
  (`release/chgame_sdboot_static.bin`), *Tools > Programmer* **CHGame USB**,
  *Tools > Burn Bootloader*.
  No driver, no buttons. The installed sketch is erased. It needs a board
  package that carries this bootloader and `chgame-upload` 0.2.0 (the next
  release; [docs/roadmap.md](../../docs/roadmap.md)).
- **By hand, the same thing:** `chgame-upload selfupdate
  release/chgame_sdboot.bin` ([host/go](host/go/README.md)), or
  `chgame uploader selfupdate release/chgame_sdboot.bin --yes` (the Python
  uploader, `host/py`).
- **Factory ISP:** hold BOOT across power-on, then `wchisp flash
  release/chgame_sdboot.bin`.
- **The first time:** [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) has two routes. The direct
  route goes straight to `chgame_sdboot.bin`, with fallbacks. The staged
  route is HW1, HW2a, HW2b.
- **The Arduino IDE caveat.** The installed board package 0.2.4 offers only
  the factory ISP and writes its own 0.2.4 bootloader. The Bootloader menu
  and the USB programmer are in `platform/board` and come with the next
  release.

## Where it came from

It began as the bootloader of CH32SerialBoot v0.2.4 (5de3006): that
repository's `bootloader/` flattened into this folder, plus `shared/`,
`host/py/`, `host/go/`, `test/` and two `tools/` scripts. CH32SerialBoot is frozen; this
folder is the bootloader's home, and the list of changes above is measured
against that starting point. MIT licence ([LICENSE](LICENSE)); third-party notices in
[THIRD-PARTY.md](THIRD-PARTY.md) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).
