/*
 * CHGame package (.CHG), format version 1 - the file the SD game menu
 * installs. spec/chg.md is the normative description; tools/chgpack.py
 * (repository root) writes and checks these files and mirrors every constant
 * here.
 *
 *   0x000  512-byte header (all fields little-endian)
 *   0x200  payload: the program image exactly as chgame-upload would write it
 *          at CHGAME_APP_START (the sketch .bin padded with 0xFF to a
 *          multiple of 4)
 *   ...    optional: the game's picture, which the visual menu shows and the
 *          install ignores
 *   ...    optional: the game's record (JSON), which only the PC and web tools
 *          read, to back the game up from a card
 *
 * The package never names a flash address: the destination is always
 * CHGAME_APP_START, and layout_id says which memory map it was built for.
