 * this C bootloader, the Python development uploader, and the Web Serial page.

 * Frame:
 *   'C' 'G' | ver u8 | cmd u8 | len u16 LE | payload[len] | crc16 u16 LE
 *            \______________ CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE ________/
 *
 * Responses echo the command with bit 7 set; payload[0] is a status code.
 * A frame that fails CRC is answered with ERR_FRAME and the parser resynchronises
 * by scanning for the next 'C','G'.

 * 512 lets a WRITE carry a whole 256-byte flash page plus its 4-byte offset,
 * so the device commits exactly one page per frame.
 *
 * Frames therefore span several 64-byte USB packets, which is ordinary USB and
 * works. Recorded because it cost a day: this was briefly capped to 56 on the
 * belief that the vendored CDC driver could not receive multi-packet
 * transfers. It could. The real fault was the SysTick direction bug in sys.c -
 * a bogus elapsed time made the inter-frame timeout reset the parser between
 * every pair of packets, producing a symptom that imitated a broken USB stack
 * almost perfectly (a hard cliff at exactly the 64-byte packet size). See
 * sys.c for the calibration that now prevents it.

 * first bytes of the NEXT frame (its length field absorbs the 'C'), so a host
 * that died mid-frame poisons the first command of the next session.
 * A full 520-byte frame crosses USB CDC in single-digit milliseconds, so this is
 * enormously generous and can never fire on a healthy transfer. */
