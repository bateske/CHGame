"""M6: repeated end-to-end upload cycles, unattended.

    python test/hil/test_soak.py --cycles 100

Each cycle is the complete user-visible operation: 1200-baud touch on a running
sketch, wait for the bootloader, erase, write, device-side CRC, host-side
readback, launch, and confirm the sketch re-enumerated.

Two different images are alternated deliberately. Uploading the same bytes
repeatedly would pass even if the device quietly ignored the write and kept
running the previous sketch; alternating means every cycle has to actually
change what is in flash, and the readback proves it did.

Failures are recorded and the soak continues, because the interesting question
is the failure RATE, not the first failure.
