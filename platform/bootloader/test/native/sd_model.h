/* SPI-mode SD card model (SD Physical Layer Simplified Spec, ch. 7), detailed
 * enough to exercise the bootloader's driver: power-up clocks, CMD0/8/55/41/
 * 58/16/17/12, SDSC byte vs SDHC block addressing, slow initialisation, read
 * latency, error tokens, read timeouts, and a card left mid-transfer by an
 * MCU reset (a CMD18 stream or a CMD25 waiting for data). The card's data is
 * an image file read on demand. It lives in shared memory: like the real
 * card, it keeps its state across an MCU reset. */
