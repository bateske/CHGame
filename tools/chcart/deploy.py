"""Putting a cart on a CHGame: the deploy rules of spec/card.md.

    one game, no SD files    flash it (and, with a card, add its CHG file to
                             GAMES/ so the menu lists it)
    one game with SD files   its SD files and CHG file onto the card, then
                             flash it
    several games            the cart's whole GAMES/ tree and SD files onto
                             the card; flash the launch game if it names one

A single game joins whatever the card holds: GAMES/MENU.IDX and MENU.BG are
left alone, and a different game already using its file name keeps it (the
new one takes the next free name). A cart of several games brings its own
menu: its MENU.IDX and MENU.BG replace the card's, and --clean empties
GAMES/ first. The card is any mounted FAT16/FAT32 folder: a card reader, or
the CHGame itself after SD CARD READER in the menu (CHSDtoUSB).
